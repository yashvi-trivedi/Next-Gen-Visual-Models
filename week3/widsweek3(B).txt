Model1: Basic vanilla VAE
Model2: Encoder replaced with encoder-decoder architecture
Model3: Decoder replaced with encoder-decoder architecture
Model4: Encoder and Decoder replaced with encoder-decoder architecture

Model	Error
[1]	0.009744472519418373
[2]	0.8806044319044611
[3]	0.025893902220319804
[4]	0.026452232309875465

Hence, since the accuracy of the vanilla VAE is higher, it is the better architecture.
